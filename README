England Twitter Spelling Contest
======

Mashup created for a university module on browser based application design. Draws data from Twitter, google maps and data.gov.uk.

The website scans recent tweets from each 'region' of the UK, checks the spelling of each and averages a score of mispellings per region. This data is then compared to government stats on employment rates in each region. Whatever correlation you draw from that is your opinion ;)
